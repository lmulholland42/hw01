## Early Life

I was born in Queens, New York in 1993. My family moved to [Bridgewater, New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgewater_Township,_New_Jersey) in 1994. I am the oldest of four children.
I have three yonger brothers: Paul, Joe, and Kevin. I've always loved growing up with lots of siblings (most of the time). I graduated from Bridgewater-Raritan High School in 2001.

##Undergraduate
I went to Drew University in Madison, NJ. I majored in anthropology and minored in economics, public health, and history. I graduated in 2015. 

## Present
I'm in CIR at University of Chicago. My thesis is on far-right white nationalism in America and globalization.
I live in Hyde Park with my dog, Roxy. Roxy's a 6 year old yellow labrador. Her **favorite** things, in no particular order, are:

1. Walks!

2. Treats!

3. Pets!

4. Snuggles!

5. Eating garbage!
